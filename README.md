**###Recommondation Sysytem**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
As Netflix's content library continues to rapidly expand, subscribers face increasing difficulty in discovering new titles that align with their personal interests and tastes. The sheer volume of available movies and TV shows makes manual browsing an inefficient and frustrating process, as users must sift through vast catalogs to identify relevant options amidst nuanced preferences.
To address this challenge, there is a growing need for an accurate and personalized recommendation system that can effectively match users with enjoyment-optimized viewing options based on a specific movie or TV show they have already watched and enjoyed. By leveraging a user's positive experience with a particular title, the system can analyze its characteristics and identify other similar titles the user is likely to appreciate.
However, developing such a robust recommendation engine requires access to proprietary data on user viewing histories, content preferences, and behavioral patterns â€“ information that streaming platforms like Netflix closely guard. This lack of transparency presents barriers to external entities aiming to innovate in this space, underscoring the value of a recommendation system tailored specifically to the Netflix platform and its unique dataset.
